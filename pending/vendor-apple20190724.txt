[IPP] RFC: Registration Template for printer-firmware-xxx attributes

AirPrint has long defined several Printer Status attributes providing the
current firmware names, patches, and versions associated with a Printer.  These
are based on the corresponding PWG Hardcopy Device Health Assessment Attributes
[PWG5110.1] and require that each of these attributes have the same cardinality
(number of values), for example:

   printer-firmware-name           = 'IPP Server','PDF Interpreter'
   printer-firmware-string-version = '4.2', '2.0r6'
   printer-firmware-patches        = '',''
   printer-firmware-version        = <0402>,<020006>

Apple would like to officially register these in the IANA IPP Registry.  The
template is as follows:


Printer Status attributes:                            Reference
------------------------------                        ---------
printer-firmware-name (1setOf name(MAX))              [APPLE20190724]
printer-firmware-patches (1setOf text(MAX))           [APPLE20190724]
printer-firmware-string-version (1setOf text(MAX))    [APPLE20190724]
printer-firmware-version (1setOf octetString(MAX))    [APPLE20190724]
