All,

Apple would like to register a new "ipp-features-supported" keyword value of 'icc-color-matching', which specifies that a Printer supports ICC-based color matching, the "printer-icc-profiles" Printer Description attribute, and embedded ICC color profiles in documents.

The registration template is as follows:

Attributes (attribute syntax)
  Keyword Attribute Value                                Reference
  -----------------------                                ---------
ipp-features-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)            [PWG5100.13]
  icc-color-matching                                     [APPLE20160824]
