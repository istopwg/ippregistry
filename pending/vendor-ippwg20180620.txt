The IPP workgroup would like to obsolete the "access-x509-certificate"
member attribute of the "destination-accesses" [PWG5100.17] and
"document-access" [PWG5100.18] operation attributes.  This member attribute
cannot be implemented securely since:

1. Use of an X.509 certificate for TLS authentication requires access to the
   corresponding private key;
2. Sending the private key to a Printer would effectively compromise the
   X.509 certificate, violating security policies; and
3. Using an unauthenticated X.509 certificate provides no security.

There are no known implementations of this member attribute.
