All,

A recent issue on the Javascript IPP project (https://github.com/williamkapke/ipp/issues/72) highlights an issue with the "page-ranges (1setOf rangeOfInteger)" Job Template attribute, namely that a Client cannot discover how many ranges a printer supports.  The existing "page-ranges-supported (boolean)" attribute only specifies whether the "page-ranges" Job Template attribute is supported and not the maximum number of values a Printer supports.  Moreover, existing Printers seem to ignore extra values without reporting this in the unsupported attributes group of the Create-Job/Print-Job/Print-URI/Validate-Job response, so from the perspective of the Client nothing has gone wrong.

For other attributes we have a "max-xxx" Printer Description attribute that tells the Client how many values can be specified, e.g., "max-stitching-locations-supported" and "max-materials-col-supported".  I therefore propose to register a new "max-page-ranges-supported (integer(1:MAX))" Printer Description attribute that a Printer can return to specify the number of page ranges the Printer supports.

Here is the registration template:


Printer Description attributes:               Reference
------------------------------                ---------
max-page-ranges-supported (integer(1:MAX))    [IPP20190711]
